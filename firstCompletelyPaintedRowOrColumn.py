# # You are given a 0-indexed integer array arr, and an m x n integer matrix mat. arr and mat both contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n].
# #
# # Go through each index i in arr starting from index 0 and paint the cell in mat containing the integer arr[i].
# #
# # Return the smallest index i at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in mat.
#
# Example 1:
#
# image explanation for example 1
# Input: arr = [1,3,4,2], mat = [[1,4],[2,3]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at arr[2].
# Example 2:
#
# image explanation for example 2
# Input: arr = [2,8,7,4,1,3,5,6,9], mat = [[3,2,5],[1,4,6],[8,7,9]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The second column becomes fully painted at arr[3]
